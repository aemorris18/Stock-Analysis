Green Stocks Analysis

Overview
Evaluate Green Energy Stocks for Steve’s parents to determine where there money will provide the most value. Steve’s parents have chosen to place all their money in ‘DAQ0’ stocks and Steve wants to show them the analysis of several green stocks for the last two years.

2017 Analysis
The data was run for 2017 and 2018 on 12 separate stocks. In 2017 many of the Green Energy Stocks did well and churned a profit for their shareholders. The exception  being ‘TERP’ stock with a return loss of 7.2%. The top 4 stocks for 2017 were ‘DQ’ with 199.4% return, ‘SEDG’ with 184.5% return, ‘ENPH’ with 129.5% return, and ‘FSLR’ with 101.3% return.

2018 Analysis
2018 was not a good year for Green Energy Stocks as all showed losses with the exception of  ‘ENPH’ with 81.9% return and ‘Run’ with 84.0% return. The top highest losses belong to ‘DQ’ with 62.6% loss of return, ‘JKS’ with 60.5% loss of return and ‘SPWR’ with a 44.6% loss of return.

Overall ‘ENPH’ has had two solid years of returns, making it the best stock for return value for Steve’s parents.

Challenges
While ‘ENPH’ has the best return value for the last two years we are missing critical data in this analysis.  How long will Steve’s parents hold the stock? When were the company’s formed and their history of return since formation? Answers to these questions would allow for a more informed decision on which stock to invest in. We are currently handicapped with only a two year look back period.

	The original has only factored one year whereas refactoring gave us both years in a matter of seconds.
